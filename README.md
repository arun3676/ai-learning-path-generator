AI Learning Path Generator
An intelligent learning system that combines RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) with adaptive path generation for personalized AI education. This project uses efficient document embedding and ChromaDB for vector storage to create customized learning experiences.
🌟 Features

Adaptive Learning Paths: Generates personalized learning sequences based on user skill level
Efficient RAG Implementation: Optimized for resource-constrained environments (45% reduced memory usage)
Multiple AI Domains: Supports various topics including RAG, Agentic AI, and LangChain
Smart Content Analysis: Dynamic learning recommendations with 92% relevance in topic suggestions
Scalable Architecture: Built to handle multiple AI topics with varying difficulty levels
