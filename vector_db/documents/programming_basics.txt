2. Control Structures
- Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while)
- Functions and methods

3. Basic Syntax
- Use semicolons to end statements
- Use curly braces for code blocks
- Indentation is important for readability

4. Common Programming Languages
- Python: Easy to learn, great for beginners
- JavaScript: For web development
- Java: Enterprise applications
- C++: System programming

5. Best Practices
- Write clear, readable code
- Use meaningful variable names
- Comment your code
